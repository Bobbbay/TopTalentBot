=> Person A posts
=> Persons B, C, and D type a rating in the comments:
=> Person A says !toptalent 10
=> Person B says !toptalent 8
=> Person C says !toptalent 4
=> Bot calculates the average of all of these (in this case 7.3) and makes a stickied comment with it.
=> Person A gets the flair of 7.3 (whatever currency you want here, for example a Õ” looks cool ðŸ˜†)
=> Person A makes more posts, them being with a rating of 9.6 and 6.0
=> Average of all Person A's posts goes to their flair (in this case 7.7).
=> Optional: highest rating of the month gets a mod award or something else to add an incentive
